A Guided Tour to Pytorch

In the first few weeks of the project, we went through courses on Coursera to learn the basic theory and fundamentals associated with deep learning.<br>
The courses were based on Introduction to deep-learning,Hyperparamter Tuning and Convolutional Neural Networks<br>

We further went through some videos online for practical implementation of deep learning using PyTorch package and it's libraries.<br>
The code consists of an assignment, and other programs based on implementing a variety of neural network architectures using the PyTorch package

The next part consisted of implementing advanced neural network architectures using the PyTorch package<br>
The project included working on ResNets,Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders.The general procedure to implement them was as follows:<br>
<ol type='1'>
  <li>Creating the Neural Network by using torch.nn and torch.nn.Module by deciding the number of layers, number of nodes in each layer and the activation functions at the end of each layer</li>
  <li>Deciding and Initialising the loss function, optimizing algorithm</li>
  <li>Downloading the training data and creating an enumerater to load it</li>
  <li>Setting up the hyperparameters like learning rate, number of epochs and training the neural network based on the data</li>
  <li>Evaluate the working of the neural network using test data</li>
</ol>
